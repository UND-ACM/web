Interested in learning game development? In this 1.5-hour seminar, you'll learn the creative process of game development
and the many facets of the design and development work involved in the process.  

It's recommended that you also attend our [Game Design I seminar](/events/2025-09-17-game_development_i.html), however,
this isn't strictly required.
